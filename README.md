A Java swing application which graphs and solves quadratic functions specified by the user. It also has an option for asking the user to find the roots of a randomly generated quadratic function based on difficulty level. Good way to practice and visualize quadratic equation problems!


To run the program, run the FunctionApparatus.java file.
